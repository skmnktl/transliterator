The maps here are generated using the mapping at [indic-transliteration](https://github.com/indic-transliteration/common_maps/blob/master/roman/slp1.toml).

A simple way to produce the relevant maps is to provide them to chatGPT and ask for the transformation we need. 

For our input char, we are choosing SLP1. It has the advantage of being a single ascii char for each input char. 

There are some deviations of course for characters not in use in Sanskrit; for those we use the manufactured additions in indic-transliteration.
